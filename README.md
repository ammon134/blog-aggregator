# Blog aggregator

## Description

It's a web server that allows clients to:

- Add RSS feeds to be collected
- Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
- Fetch all of the latest posts from the RSS feeds they follow

## TODO

- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Support pagination of the endpoints that can return many items
- [ ] Support different options for sorting and filtering posts using query parameters
- [ ] Add a CLI client to fetch and display posts for reading in the terminal
- [ ] Scrape lists of feeds themselves from a site that aggregates feed URLs
